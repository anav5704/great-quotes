# Great Quotes âœ¨

![hero image](https://github.com/anav5704/great-quotes/blob/main/docs/great-quotes.png)

This is a simple web app that hosts some great quotes my
friends and I have said throughout highschool nad
university. Users can create, update and delete their own
quotes after logging in. This project Next JS on the
front-end with Prisma and Drizzle connected to a PostgreSQL
database hosted on Neon. This was my first go at testing so
I've used Jest for unit testing, and Cypress for end-to-end
testing and Storybook for component testing.

## Technologies Used

-   Next JS 14
-   TailwindCSS
-   Next UI
-   Jest
-   Cypress
-   Storybook
-   Next Auth
-   Prisma
-   Drizzle
-   Neon PostgreSQL

## Getting Started

First fork and clone the repo. Then, run `npm install` to
download all the dependencies. Now, set up your
environmental variables. Make a `.env` file in the root of
your project with the following variables:

```
NEXTAUTH_URL
NEXTAUTH_SECRET
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
DIRECT_URL
DATABASE_URL
```

Once that is done, run `npm run dev` to view it on
localhost.

## Running Tests

To run unit tests, run `npm run test:unit:run`. For
end-to-end, you will need to spin up a local dev server
first. After that, to run `npm run test:e2e:run`. And
finally, for component tests, start Storybook by running
`npm run storybook` then run `npm run test:component:run` to
run the tests.
