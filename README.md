# Great Quotes üèÜ

<!-- ![hero](https://github.com/anav5704/great-quotes/blob/main/docs/great-quotes.png) -->

This is a simple web app that hosts some great quotes my friends and I have said throughout highschool nad university. Users can create, update and delete their own quotes and like others quotes after logging in. This project uses the T3 stack and some services offered by Vercel (storage and hosting).

## Technologies Used

- Next JS 14
- TailwindCSS
- Next UI 
- Next Auth
- Prisma
- Vercel PostgreSQL
- tRPC
- Cryptr 

## Getting Started

First fork and clone the repo. Then, run ```npm install``` to download all the dependencies. Now, set up your environmental variables. Make a ```.env``` file in the root of your project with the following variables:

```
NEXTAUTH_URL 
NEXTAUTH_SECRET 
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID  
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET 
POSTGRES_URL  
POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL 
POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING 
POSTGRES_USER 
POSTGRES_HOST 
POSTGRES_PASSWORD 
POSTGRES_DATABASE
```

This project also allows quotes to be encrypted (using Cryptr) but is disabled by default. If you want to enable it, uncomment the code for encryption in ```src\server\api\routers\quote.ts``` and add the following environment variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CRYPTR 
NEXT_CRYPTR 
```

Once that is done, run ```npm run dev``` to view it on localhost.
